# Star Wars Quiz - Personal Project 2

I wanted to continue the Star Trek theme into this second project, but after starting planning I decided I should make some new research on colour palettes and typography to ensure my grade is reached, so I will be going with a Star Wars quiz instead. This quiz will take the user through 10 questions from various Star Wars films, with a right and a wrong answer. There will be a visual cue upon choosing correctly or incorrectly to help the user to see how they answered.

On my future implementations on my Star Trek Museum project I noted that I wished to add a twinkling star background to the page but that would require JS. I think coding the background is going to showcase my JS abilities just as equally as the code used to write the quiz, so I feel like I will be covering my bases well on showing my understanding of basic JS.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

The site will be a clean and concise, one page application, with a clear interface to allow for quick understanding of the page content and purpose. Since the site is going to be quite ambiguous, the new visitors and returning visitors goals will be the same.

The user should be able to:

* Read up on how the quiz works, either by clicking an information icon/button or with a short blurb of text.
* Track their score in real time after each question is answered.
* Have a visual indication on which was the right or wrong answer once they have made their choice.
* Have their score enlarged/highlighted at the end of the round.
* Have an option to reset the quiz and start again.
* Add-on after MVP to have localhost saving the scores locally on their machine.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The main colours of the Star Wars opening theme is simply, black, white and yellow (for which I have found the nice hexcode of #FFE81F), along with the starry background I will be creating with HTML/CSS/JS. In case of needing further colours, I sourced a nice The Old Republic color palette created by someone on [Color-hex](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/22099)

### Typography

I started looking up what sort of fonts could try to imitate the famous Star Wars logo and font. It isn't easy to replicate exactly with just Google Fonts but I chose the Roboto font with a sans-serif backup to come as close as possible whilst maintaining good UX/readability. I chose font weight 700 and 900 to keep the thick look of the original text.

### Imagery

At the time of planning I am uncertain if there will be any imagery used, as the background "image" will be coded by myself and the main theme of the text on Star Wars is the well-known yellow border, black background and white text. For the MVP I will not plan images but they may go in as an add-on once I've completed the bulk of my project.

### Wireframes

## Features

The key concept was to have a main window where you can see the score, and then a window would appear ontop of this one when the info/start game buttons were clicked. From there you could close the window with the X, and when playing the game you would click on one of the options to continue through the quiz, whilst being able to see your updated score in the main window behind the quiz window.

No header needed on this page, but there will be a footer with fake socials on it, along with a note about the quiz. A little Grogu currently resides in the favicon slot, although it's hard to see what it is for now, he may get swapped out.

### Future Implementations

In the future I would like to implement difficulty levels, as well as more options to choose from rather than the current 50/50 chance of choosing correctly or not.

### Accessibility

Due to the simple nature of the page there are few accessibility concerns. I chose a font that has a Star Wars essence without the grouping together of letters that happens on the official font, as that could impact screen reader's ability to separate the letters effectively.

In regards to the colour palette, the contrast of black, white and yellow allows for a clear, clean interface. 

I don't want to deviate from the original colour palette so I have to think of a good way to visually indicate whether the user has answered correctly or not, to avoid red/green colours on the answers as this can negatively impact the experience for colour blind users.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - Used to collect hexcode colour palette.

[Picresize](https://picresize.com/) - Used to resize images.

### Languages Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Overcoming obstacles

Writing JavaScript can be done in so many ways, meaning you can produce the same result with 5 lines of code as you can for 20. Wanting to impart the DRY methodology as much as possible into my code I worked very hard to write as little code as possible. With the knowledge I had up until this point it was a challenge as what I had learned vs what I wanted to do didn't quite line up, so it took me a long time to get the first function written. Here are some of the obstacles I faced and how I managed to eventually succeed.

### Getting unstuck

### Bug fixes

[Parade](https://parade.com/1161189/alexandra-hurtado/star-wars-trivia/) - Where I sourced my quiz questions and answers from.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

### ¬†Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
### ¬†Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
